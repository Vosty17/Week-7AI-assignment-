**Fairness Analysis of COMPAS Risk Scores Using AI Fairness 360**

This project analyzed racial bias in the COMPAS recidivism risk scores using IBMâ€™s AI Fairness 360 toolkit. The COMPAS dataset, which includes demographic and criminal history features, was explored and preprocessed to enable fairness assessment. The analysis focused on the two-year recidivism prediction, with race as the protected attribute.

**Key Findings:**

> **Major Findings:**
> 
> - **Disparities in Recidivism Rates:** Initial analysis revealed clear differences in recidivism rates across racial groups.
> - **Bias in Risk Scores:** Disparate impact and statistical parity difference metrics indicated bias against unprivileged groups (e.g., African-American defendants).
> - **Model Fairness Gaps:** The logistic regression model showed significant differences in false positive rates, false negative rates, and equal opportunity between racial groups.
> - **Visualization Evidence:** Confusion matrices and ROC curves by race confirmed that the model was less accurate and more likely to misclassify unprivileged group members.

**Remediation Steps:**

To address these biases, we applied the Reweighing algorithm from AIF360, which adjusts instance weights to reduce the influence of bias in the training data. Post-mitigation fairness metrics showed improvement in disparate impact and statistical parity difference, indicating a reduction in bias. However, some disparities persisted, suggesting that further remediation may be necessary.

**Recommendations:**

- Use bias mitigation algorithms such as reweighing or adversarial debiasing during model training.
- Regularly monitor fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact, equal opportunity difference) alongside accuracy.
- Consider additional features or alternative modeling approaches to further reduce bias.
- Engage stakeholders to interpret results and ensure that remediation aligns with ethical and legal standards.

In summary, while mitigation techniques can reduce bias, ongoing evaluation and a multi-faceted approach are essential for fair and responsible use of risk assessment tools like COMPAS.
